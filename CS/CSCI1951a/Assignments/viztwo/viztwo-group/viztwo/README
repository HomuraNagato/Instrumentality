### ekasbohm's README ###

I think my visualization went pretty well!  As far as I can tell, 
there aren't any bugs in the way each states' donations are portrayed.

I used Python (ek_narrow_data.py) to generate a CSV file (state_donations.csv) 
that had just the state abbreviations and their total donations from the 
original JSON file.

I also created separate CSS and JavaScript files so that index.html could be 
kept pretty clean.

I didn't collaborate with anyone in the class on this project, 
but I did make use of the following online resources:

	## Data ##
	- United States topojson data from mbostock (saved as states.json in the 
	  data subdirectory) helped me figure out borders for each state:
		https://github.com/mbostock/topojson/blob/master/examples/us-10m.json

	- mbostock's TSV file that matches state names and abbreviations with the 
	  ids used in the topojson file (saved as us-state-names.tsv in the data 
	  subdirectory):
	  	https://gist.github.com/mbostock/4090846#file-us-state-names-tsv

	## D3 ##
	- The Heatmap resource from Viz 1 (http://bl.ocks.org/tjdecke/5558084) was
	  useful for figuring out legends and map coloring.

	- Mike Bostock also created a useful tutorial for making a map:
		https://bost.ocks.org/mike/map/

	- Options for map coloring were outlined here:
