    Idea for visualization: To make a graph of the number of views of each category by age_range. If an age_range has any outliers, then BootLoader can target those users with projects in that category. If age_range doesn't show any difference, can also look at other variables like gender or maritial status.

    <p>This bar chart shows the number of events in Bootloader for each category filtered on age and being single. To do this, the program narrow_category.py was used to format the data in a usable form. Then category_popyularity.js took these csv files to make a bar chart.</p>
