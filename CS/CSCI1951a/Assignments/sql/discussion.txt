The Snowflake schema contains types that may contain subtypes that are unique. The Star schema contains types that may have a few redundant properties. The strength of using the snowflake schema is being better able to look at similar but different types. The strength of using the star schema is being better able to look at larger differences in the data. For example, the snowflake schema would be able to look at the difference between beds and couches, where in the star schema, one would have to select for Bed_size without Legs to get beds.
