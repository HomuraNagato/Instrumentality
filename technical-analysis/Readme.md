## Data:

Crypto data is obtained from: http://api.bitcoincharts.com/v1/csv/
Current data for BTC / USD exchange rate we use data from CoinBaseUSD, from December 1st 2014 - December 31st, 2018
And for the BTC / JPY exchange rate we use CoinCheckJPY, from Halloween 2014 - December 31st, 2018

Following [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/trading/factors-influence-exchange-rates/) we want to include the following 6 variables, that are thought to move the currencies that we use today.  It will be interesting to see if these have any predictive power for cryptocurrencies. 

# Exchange Rate Data: from FRED St. Luis Fed
  1) Differentials in Intererst Rates: 3-Month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), based on a basket of currencies:
      * :ballot_box_with_check: Japanese Yen (JPY3MTD156N), US Dollar (USD3MTD156N), Euro (EUR3MTD156N), and British Pound (GBP3MTD156N)
      * :ballot_box_with_check: To create differential, we take the mean across these four item, then difference each respective rate against this mean

# IRP and UIRP models
Collect interest rates on these currencies to model these popular exchange rates
use for comparison: the top currencies to buy BTC, from [Coinhills](https://www.coinhills.com/market/currency/)
at time of writing: USD 70.39%, JPY 20.03%, KRW 6.07%, EUR 1.39%, GBP 0.88%, and CNY .01% (included as back in 2014, 2015 it was in the first position [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/tech/top-fiat-currencies-used-trade-bitcoin/))
Then take the average of these as the foreign interest rate, and USA as the base
