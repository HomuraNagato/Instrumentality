## Data:

Crypto data is obtained from: http://api.bitcoincharts.com/v1/csv/
Current data for BTC / USD exchange rate we use data from CoinBaseUSD, from December 1st 2014 - December 31st, 2018
And for the BTC / JPY exchange rate we use CoinCheckJPY, from Halloween 2014 - December 31st, 2018

Following [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/trading/factors-influence-exchange-rates/) we want to include the following 6 variables, that are thought to move the currencies that we use today.  It will be interesting to see if these have any predictive power for cryptocurrencies.
